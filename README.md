**Formatting with pre-commit**

pre-commit is a tool that is used in this repository to check and apply style guidelines automatically. To install pre-commit into your system:

    pip3 install pre-commit

Then under root directory install the git hooks like this:

    pre-commit install

With this pre-commit will automatically run and check a list of styling including clang-format, end of files and trailing whitespaces whenever you run `git commit`. To run pre-commit any time other than `git commit`:

    pre-commit run -a

**Formatting with spotless**

The formatting of the Java code will be checked with every CI build. Run the following command to fix formatting errors:

    ./gradlew spotlessApply
